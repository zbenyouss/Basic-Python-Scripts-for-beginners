# Basic-Python-Scripts-for-beginners

The goal of this project is to help beginners get exposed to python and understand the different uses of while statement, if and else statement, user input functionality, etc. The scripts are simplified and easy to use. 
I am using Linux Kali environment with python3 (personal preference) but any other python friendly environment can work. 

Steps to making an executable and running the code:

1. Please copy and Past the codes in text editor.
2. Save the file in format filename.py
3. Go to terminal (bash) 
4. Locate the file by typing cd /path/to/file then hit enter
5. Type chmod 755 filename.py then hit enter (this command will create an executable file that you will be able to run)
4. type ./filename.py then hit enter
5. The code will execute accordingly
