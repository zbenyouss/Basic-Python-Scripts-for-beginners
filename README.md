# Basic-Python-Scripts-for-beginners

The goal of this project is to help beginners get exposed to python and understand the different uses of while statement, if and else statement, user input functionality, etc. The scripts are simplified and easy to use. 
I am using Linux Kali environment with python3 (personal preference) but any other python friendly environment can work.
